# Predicting Students' Sucess or Risk of Dropping out

This repository contains the code for the coursework of Data Science course at UGR. The objective of this assignment is to develop a predictive model to predict a studentâ€™s success or risk of dropping out based on a number of information known at the time of student enrollment; academic trajectory, demographics and social-economic factors. 

The data is analyzed and effective predictive models were built. All the techniques studied along the course were considered, namely:

1. KNN (mknn)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (mlda)
3. Logistic Regression (mlr)
4. Classification trees (mtree)
5. Random Forests (mrf)
6. Artificial Neural Networks (Multi-layered perceptrons) (mann)
7. Support Vector Machines (msvm)
8. Clustering techniques.
